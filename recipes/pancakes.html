    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is linguine alla vongole, which is clam spaghetti, but much more fun to say. With layers of clam flavor from clam juice, canned clams, and freshly steamed clams, and a rich, herbed wine sauce, this dish is something truly special.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups dry milk powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift all-purpose flour, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in whole wheat flour. In a small bowl, combine sugar, eggs, water, butter and vinegar. Make a well in the flour mixture, and pour in the egg mixture. Mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.</li>
