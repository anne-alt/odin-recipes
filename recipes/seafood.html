    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is linguine alla vongole, which is clam spaghetti, but much more fun to say. With layers of clam flavor from clam juice, canned clams, and freshly steamed clams, and a rich, herbed wine sauce, this dish is something truly special.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 white onion, minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour a thin layer of olive oil into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onions and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper, and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour in white wine, bay leaves, parsley, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and salt. Increase heat to bring mixture to a simmer; cook until volume is reduced by half.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in bottled clam juice, plus clam juice from 3 cans of chopped clams (set chopped clams aside to use later in the recipe). Reduce heat to medium. Combine clam juice from remaining can of chopped clams with cornstarch in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid; place in the refrigerator to use later for thickening sauce.</li>
            <li>Simmer sauce over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to have the consistency of a sauce, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While sauce simmers, cook the pasta: bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside to keep warm.</li>
            <li>While pasta cooks, steam the clams: In a pot with a steamer rack, bring water to a boil. Steam whole clams over medium heat, covered, stirring or shaking the pot occasionally until they open, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Now, pull it all together: add chopped canned clams to sauce; cook just until heated, about 3 minutes. If the sauce is still thin, shake the refrigerated clam juice-cornstarch slurry, and pour in a little at a time; cook and stir until just thick enough–the starch from the linguine will also thicken the sauce a little.</li>
            <li>Toss linguine in the pan with clam sauce and coat evenly. Divide linguine onto individual plates; divide whole clams on top. Top with Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.</li>
       </ol>
